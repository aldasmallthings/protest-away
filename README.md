# Protest Away

## The Challenge
How do we enable people at risk of COVID-19 or unable to protest in person to support the movement through
tech?

## Why does this matter?
Physical presence as a protest is a lot more risky for people at risk of getting  COVID. This includes the elderly population, people with underlying conditions, or people who live with someone who is at-risk. (Non at risk individuals can also use this tool.) CDC reports “An estimated 60 percent of American adults have at least one chronic medical condition.” (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html)
This is a huge population of people who are now putting themselves at risk by protesting anyways, or keeping themselves from participating in activism. 

How do we keep people connected to issues that matter to them, even if they cannot go out and protest?
How do we keep people engaged in activism after the protest is over?

## Assumptions
This is not a replacement of protest, but supports it. 

## The Solution
A web application that uses 2 types of data 1. aggregated data about trending hashtags from Twitter (hashtags related to BLM movement/black issues) and 2. incidents reported on our website, to link people who cannot protest to actions they can take from their homes 

Our tool offers ways of tackling social, political, and economic activism.


## Key User Group

1 People who want to report a problem 
2 People who don't know how to help/cant help bc of COVID (our focus user for the presentation) 
3 Civic organizations who want to get connected with and act on local occurrences of racism
